# WP Plugin Example#
Prepared for the Colorado Springs 10/2015 Wp Meetup.

This is the plugin used in the presentation.

## Description ##
The Plugin adds text to a page depending on the hok it is linked to.

It was designed to be used with the Genesis Theme because of all the visual hooks the theme provide. This would allow the audience to have a much better visual understanding of how the hooks work.

## Acknowledgements 
This plugin in was originally developed by Pippin Williamson for his

[My First WordPress Plugin Tutorial](https://pippinsplugins.com/how-to-begin-writing-your-first-wordpress-plugin/ "My First WordPress Plugin Tutorial")

I changed the plugin name and instead of adding a twitter feed it just adds some text.
